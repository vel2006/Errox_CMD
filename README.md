# Errox_CMD

### Current Version:

Version: 3.7

(dont ask about 1.0)

## Basic coverage:

Errox_CMD is a collection of scripts designed to collect basic system information, (eventually) escalate privileges, and act as a shell for cmd.exe.

## How Errox_CMD works:

### TargetInstallerCreator.py

  TargetInstallerCreator.py is the new installer creation tool for Errox_CMD. Instead of there being a single large installer file (annoying to deal with) I have instead decided to have version 3.0 bring the new installer file along with some new things that the info collection script can look for. This installer does not rely on internet sites or connection to work, it simply creates the files from plaintext source code. This installer file is designed to create a file (either C or Python currently) that you get to choose the language of, so in the event that a certain language or file type is not allowed to run on the device you can avoid blockage via using another language for the installer file. Once the installer file has created the files, it will run them. It runs a basic Lay of The Land (LTL) batch script, that was customized when creating the installer file. After the LTL file runs, the shell runs, currently it can only be either batch or python script. Below is an explination of how each works.

  Version 3.7 brought changes to how the dictionary is handled inside of TargetInstallerCreator.py. Instead of using a static dictionary of commands, anyone can now simply edit the contents of each directory holding commands, and even add their own! This allows for the script to be more versatile and change on the fly with each user's needs.

  ### Batch shell:

  Works by abusing how Batch is the same language used to make cmd.exe work, meaning that the user can input the same commands as they would in a user created instance of cmd. This also means that it bypasses the blocking of a user creating a cmd process.

  ### Python shell:

  Works by calling cmd.exe through subprocess (has not been tested for bypassing the blockage of cmd.exe yet) and constantly reading it's output, meaning that the process never closes or halts. While a crude method, it does work. The input is then fed into the subprocess input, executed, then read due to the constant reading of the process. While, this can be detected by it's long cmd.exe process, it does pass any pure file scan.

## Out dated information:

### Version 2

#### Installer.bat

  Installer.bat is the first installer file for Errox_CMD. You simply need to recreate or run this file on the device you wish to have Errox_CMD on and BAM there it is, however this file does depend NOT on github being blocked on the network that the device running Installer.bat is on. This is due to Installer.bat testing to see if a connection page is up and responding, if it is then Installer.bat will install all other files through web requests. If the page is not reachable or doesnt respond, then Installer.bat will create the hard coded in versions inside of itself through base64.
  
  Example of Installer.bat running with no internet connection:
  
    Testing if GitHub repo is reachable...
    GitHub not reachable, creating via base64...
    Creating GatherSystemInfo script...
    Creating BatchTerminal script...
    Creating InstallPython script...
    Creating Main script...
    Install Script ended, run main.bat for Errox_CMD              

  Example of Installer.bat running with GitHub reachable:

    Testing if GitHub repo is reachable...
    GitHub is reachable, creating via download...
    Getting GatherSystemInfo script...
    Getting BatchTerminal script...
    Getting InstallPython script...
    Getting Main script...
    Install Script ended, run main.bat for Errox_CMD

#### main.bat:
  
  Runs GatherSystemInfo.bat, BatchTerminal.bat, and InstallPython.bat. It is the script that runs all of the other files, its not a needed file and is only here for automation and convenience.

  Example of main.bat running:

     _____                        ____ __  __ ____
    | ____|_ __ _ __ _____  __   / ___|  \/  |  _ \
    |  _| | '__| '__/ _ \ \/ /  | |   | |\/| | | | |
    | |___| |  | | | (_) >  <   | |___| |  | | |_| |
    |_____|_|  |_|  \___/_/\_\___\____|_|  |_|____/
                            |_____|

#### GatherSystemInfo.bat:
  As in the name, this script is designed to gather system information like network connectsions and users on the device (for an example of the data collected, check below). Collected data is sent into files named .hotfixes.txt, .route.txt and so on. While the data is held inside of a cleartext within the .txt files, future updates will have the ability to encrypt the data using an XOR operation for basic obfuscation and bypass Windows Defender.

  Example data of the .all_groups.txt file:

    Aliases for \\<DEVICE_NAME>

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    *Administrators
    *Device Owners
    *Distributed COM Users
    *Event Log Readers
    *Guests
    *Hyper-V Administrators
    *IIS_IUSRS
    *Performance Log Users
    *Performance Monitor Users
    *Remote Management Users
    *System Managed Accounts Group
    *Users
    The command completed successfully.

#### BatchTerminal.bat:
  
  This file is designed to bypass the blockage of cmd.exe through the abilies that batch scripting has. It takes in a command, then executing it directly within the same process. While crude, the job gets done.

  Example of BatchTerminal.bat being executed via main.bat after GatherSystemInfo.bat has ran:

     _____                        ____ __  __ ____
    | ____|_ __ _ __ _____  __   / ___|  \/  |  _ \

#### InstallPython.bat:

  This file is designed to try and install Python version 3.12.4, it doesnt check to see if Python has been installed but I am working on that currently.

### Usage:

  First you have to get the collection of scripts onto the target system. Once the files are on (or an installer file) run the installer file if you have one, then the main.bat file. Finnaly, sit back and let the script do its thing!
